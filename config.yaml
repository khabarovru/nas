    # This can help with false positives for objects that should only be stationary for a limited amount of time.
    # It can also be used to disable stationary object tracking. For example, you may want to set a value for person, but leave
    # car at the default.
    # WARNING: Setting these values overrides default behavior and disables stationary object tracking.
    #          There are very few situations where you would want it disabled. It is NOT recommended to
    #          copy these values from the example config into your config unless you know they are needed.

  # Optional: Milliseconds to offset detect annotations by (default: shown below).
  # There can often be latency between a recording and the detect process,
  # especially when using separate streams for detect and record.
  # Use this setting to make the timeline bounding boxes more closely align
  # with the recording. The value can be positive or negative.
  # TIP: Imagine there is an event clip with a person walking from left to right.
  #      If the event timeline bounding box is consistently to the left of the person
  #      then the value should be decreased. Similarly, if a person is walking from
  #      left to right and the bounding box is consistently ahead of the person
  #      then the value should be increased.
  # TIP: This offset is dynamic so you can change the value and it will update existing
  #      events, this makes it easy to tune.
  # WARNING: Fast moving objects will likely not have the bounding box align.

  enabled: true
  # Optional: The threshold passed to cv2.threshold to determine if a pixel is different enough to be counted as motion. (default: shown below)

  threshold: 30
  # Optional: The percentage of the image used to detect lightning or other substantial changes where motion detection
  #           needs to recalibrate. (default: shown below)

  # Decreasing this value will make motion detection more likely to ignore large amounts of motion such as a person approaching
  # a doorbell camera.
  lightning_threshold: 0.8
  # Optional: Minimum size in pixels in the resized motion image that counts as motion (default: shown below)
  # Increasing this value will prevent smaller areas of motion from being detected. Decreasing will
  # make motion detection more sensitive to smaller moving objects.
  # As a rule of thumb:
  #  - 10 - high sensitivity
  #  - 30 - medium sensitivity
  #  - 50 - low sensitivity
  contour_area: 10
  # Optional: Alpha value passed to cv2.accumulateWeighted when averaging frames to determine the background (default: shown below)
  # Higher values mean the current frame impacts the average a lot, and a new object will be averaged into the background faster.
  # Low values will cause things like moving shadows to be detected as motion for longer.

  frame_alpha: 0.01
  # Optional: Height of the resized motion frame  (default: 100)
  # Higher values will result in more granular motion detection at the expense of higher CPU usage.
  # Lower values result in less CPU, but small changes may not register as motion.

  # Optional: motion mask
  # NOTE: see docs for more detailed info on creating masks

    # As an example: if you wanted to go from 24 hours to 30 minutes that would be going
    # from 86400 seconds to 1800 seconds which would be 1800 / 86400 = 0.02.
    # The -r (framerate) dictates how smooth the output video is.
